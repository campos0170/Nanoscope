# Changelog

All notable NanoScope changes are recorded here. The project is currently in private beta; beta
tags identify tested development baselines and do not promise a stable file or API surface.

## Unreleased

- No changes yet.

## 0.1.0 Beta 1 — 2026-09-03

### Added

- Interactive ABF, HDF5, TDMS, CSV, and text-trace viewing and calibration.
- Schmitt, CUSUM, ML, and manual event detection with provenance-preserving reconciliation.
- Event inspection, batch curation, structured labels, and supervised-learning exports.
- Histograms, density and scatter plots, fitting, PCA, clustering, PSD, I–V, and voltage-dependence
  analysis.
- Project persistence with guarded atomic saves and external-change conflict detection.
- Crash-recovery autosaves after 15 seconds idle, bounded by a 60-second maximum, with two atomic
  generations and Recover, Discard, and Show in Finder startup actions.
- Adaptive local-context trace navigation for efficient manual annotation.

### Validation

- 8,060 tests passed and 6 corpus/platform tests skipped in the complete Stage 2 regression.
- The packaged macOS application passed all 18 bundle self-tests, strict ad-hoc signature
  verification, and DMG checksum verification.

### Distribution limits

- The beta build targets Apple Silicon and macOS 15 or later.
- The application is ad-hoc signed but not Apple-notarized; Gatekeeper may require the documented
  first-launch workaround.
- Raw recordings are referenced by path and are not embedded in projects or recovery snapshots.
